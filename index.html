      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm William Georgeson. I am 20 years old, currently a CS Student studying at Edge Hill University,
        Ormskirk. I have been programming since 2016.
        I am abit of a data horder and like to collect and manage large amounts of it from images to
        literature to old retro TV Shows that would otherwise go extinct without people like me. I have used
        Linux for years and know the bash terminal very well.<br><br>

        I started programming in Scratch at a very early age learning it in IT classes in High School and
        then taking it outside the classroom to further develop my understanding of Programming theory.
        Once I had a good enough understanding I went on to develop little websites using HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript. Once I had a good enough understanding I started to learn some node.js which then
        developed into learning some basic Python. I would then use Visual Basic in some College courses
        as part of some set assignments. I would use Python more religiously when doing work experience,
        which also developed my love for Linux. The project was to develop a facial recognition device
        using the OpenAI.<br><br>

        I started to use Linux more and more, using the various commands built in the bash and some included
        with package managers. I have used a small amount of Shell Script to automate clearing up files on the
        Linux system to reduce memory.
        In University I revisited Python as part as my foundation year and learnt some Java. Further in my
        course I was taught how to use C# and C#/Unity.

        I was fortunate enough to be able to join a tester trial of the new T-Level the Government wanted to
        replace instead of the traditional BTEC course. During this Students were to undergo work placements
        2 days a week for a fixed amount of hours. During my experience, I was to develop a facial recognition
        device that uses OpenCV to identify faces and see if it can identify against a database of known
        employees. If it does not recognise the face, it was to inform a work collegue for a confirmation of
        if this person is granted access on the worksite. Also logging when faces are recognised and storing
        them in a database to better train the AI.
