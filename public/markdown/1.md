## Website

### Original Development



### ✨ Introducing React.js ✨

After making the website it was limited to some capacity. I wanted to develop it further by adding a blog, some interactiive elements and reduce the amount of duplicated code that is used for headers and footers. But making it in HTML/CSS and JavaScript would not be sufficient. This is where [React.js](https://react.dev/) comes in.

React.js would be able to use components to build parts of a website that can be used throughout the website. This is a much more efficient way of designing a website as editing code will be more simple.

In my React application a JSON file was used to make updating information on the website as easy as possible. This JSON file would contain all the information needed such as name, social medias, qualifications
